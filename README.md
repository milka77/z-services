## UX

I want to create a clean design for the site focused on the basic information about the company and their service.



## Features

### Existing Features

* Feature 1 (Home) - Allows users to reach the starting page from anywhere on the site. 
* Feature 2 (About Me) - A brief description of the company and from the owner.
* Feature 3 (F.A.Q.s) - Frequently asked questions about window cleaning and the company.
* Feature 4 (Contact form) - Allows users to fill and submit the form to request a free quotation for their windows will be cleaned.  

### Features left to Implement

* Collapsable menu at mobile version of the site. Need Bootstrap or JavaScript for this. 
* Picture gallery - Shows pictures before and after the work been done. 

## Technologies Used

* HTML
* CSS
* [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/ "Font Awesome Homepage") 
* [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/ "Google Fonts Homepage")
* Favicon generator [favico.io](https://favicon.io/favicon-generator/)

This project was written in HTML & CSS using Cloud9 and is currently hosted on GitHub pages. 
I used Font Awesome icons to create a nice and simple social media link section in the footer. 
As my mentor, Ali mentioned I can use [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) if I want it's allowed to use it, but he recommended that I 
should do every coding by myself that's the way how you can learn and fully understanding coding. I accepted his recommendation and not used Bootstrap. 
Every coding, styling is made by myself.

## Testing

I was testing the site with Chrome developer tools on my desktop PC, and with my iPad mini2
and on my iPhone SE. 

#### All links are working 
Tested all the links on every device which I used for testing was every link working. 
#### Testing contact form: 
* When trying to submit an empty form without the required fields an error message appears. 
* An error message appears when you try to submit the form with an invalid email address.
* After all required fields are filled out and the form was submitted a success message appears.


The site have the mobile first approach design. The navigation menu changes from a box on the top left corner on mobile version to a full width top 
fixed navigation bar on the desktop version.
