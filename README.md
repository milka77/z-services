## UX

I want to create a clean design for the site focused on the basic information about the company and their service.



## Features

### Existing Features

* Feature 1 (Home) - Allows users to reach the starting page from anywhere on the site. 
* Feature 2 (About Me) - A brief description of the company and from the owner.
* Feature 3 (F.A.Q.s) - Frequently asked questions about window cleaning and the company.
* Feature 4 (Contact form) - Allows users to fill and submit the form to request a free quotation for their windows will be cleaned.  

### Features left to Implement

* Collapsable menu at mobile version of the site. Need Bootstrap or JavaScript for this. 
* Picture gallery - Shows pictures before and after the work been done. 

## Technologies Used

* HTML
* CSS
 
As my mentor, Ali mentioned I can use [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) if I want it's allowed to use it, but he recommended that I 
should do every coding by myself that's the way how you can learn and fully understanding coding. I accepted his recommendation and not used Bootstrap. 
Every coding, styling is made by myself.

## Testing

I was testing the site with Chrome developer tools on my desktop PC, and with my iPad mini2
and on my iPhone SE. 

1. All links are working 
2. Testing contact form: 
    ..* When trying to submit an empty form without the required fields an error message appears. 
    ..* An error message appears when you try to submit the form with an invalid email address.
    ..* After all required fields are filled out and the form was submitted a success message appears.


The site have the mobile first approach design. The navigation menu changes from a box on the top left corner on mobile version to a full width top 
fixed navigation bar on the desktop version.  


## Media

* The photos used in this site were obtained from Zoltan the owner of Z Services.
